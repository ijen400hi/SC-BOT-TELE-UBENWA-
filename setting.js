Hello WhatsApp Team,

My WhatsApp account was recently banned without any clear explanation. I was surprised to see the message that my number is no longer allowed to use WhatsApp. I believe this action might be an error or automated flagging, as I never engaged in spam, bulk messaging, or violations of the Terms of Service.

I kindly ask your team to investigate this matter and consider restoring my account. WhatsApp is an important communication tool for me, and losing access has significantly disrupted my daily activities.

Thank you very much for your time and help.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Hello WhatsApp Support Team,

I'm contacting you because my WhatsApp account was permanently banned without prior notice. I understand WhatsApp's policies and I respect the effort to keep the platform safe. However, I strongly believe this ban was applied by mistake. I have never sent spam messages, used third-party apps, or violated any rules.

This account is very important for my communication with clients, colleagues, and family members. Losing it suddenly has caused serious inconvenience in my daily activities.

I kindly request your help to review my account status and restore access. If any further verification or clarification is required, I am ready to provide it.

Thank you so much for your understanding and support.

Warm regards,

Dear WhatsApp Support Team,

I am a long-time user of WhatsApp, and I am reaching out because my account linked to the number +62XXXXXXXXXXX was recently blocked permanently. I was shocked to receive this notice since I have always followed WhatsApp's Terms of Service and used the app responsibly.

I never participated in spam, mass messaging, or any kind of abusive activity that could violate your policies. My account is primarily used for personal communication and professional coordination. Therefore, I believe this block might have been triggered by an automated system error or a misunderstanding.

I kindly ask your team to conduct a manual review of my account. If there was any specific reason behind the block, I would greatly appreciate your clarification so that I can avoid such issues in the future.

WhatsApp is an essential part of my daily routine, and losing access has affected both my personal and professional communication. I sincerely hope this situation can be resolved soon.

Thank you very much for your time, understanding, and continued support.
